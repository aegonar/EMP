Electronic Parking Meter: Micro 2 Project

http://emp.parseapp.com/

  The focus of this project is to develop a convenient and efficient way to control traffic and manage payment in a parking lot.
Our system provides the parking management an easy access and payment method by implementing a Radio Frequency Identification 
(RFID) system in combination with a database that manages all the transactions and access levels. All of the RFID tags are 
going to beassigned to an individual, to provide them with an easy and convenientway of automatic payment without the need 
of a parking lot ticketmachine or cashier. The system logs the times at which a car enters and leaves the parking lot, then
the system calculates, the time the car spent in the parking lot, the total amount of money the owe according to fee and taxes,
and automatically deduct the money from the userâ€™s credit card or bank account.
